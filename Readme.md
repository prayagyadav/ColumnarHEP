# Columnar Analysis in High Energy Physics
Welcome to the ColumnarHEP! This repository contains Jupyter Notebooks and Presentations related to Columnar Analysis using data from two folders: 2022-08-01-uproot-awkward-columnar-hats/data and data. The notebooks showcase the use of tools like Uproot, Awkward Array, Coffea , etc. and draws insight from the provided datasets. Below, you'll find an overview of the repository contents and instructions on how to use the materials.

## Introduction

This repo is a documentation of my work at CMSLab, School of Physics at the University of Hyderabad. My main focus is to perform data analysis of CMS, CERN data using COFFEA framework. In this repository, you will find the presentations that I made to understand tools like Uproot, Awkward array, COFFEA , dask etc. 

## Repository Contents

Description of the contents :

- **Notebooks:** This folder contains the Jupyter Notebooks used for data analysis. Provide a brief description of each notebook, its objectives, and how it utilizes the data from the two folders.
  - `speedtest.ipynb`: Description of notebook 1.
  - `UprootAndAwkward.ipynb`: Description of notebook 2.
  - `Coffea.ipynb`: Description of notebook 3.

- **Data:** This folder contains the datasets used in the notebooks. Explain the purpose of each dataset and any data preprocessing steps you've taken.

- **Presentations:** This folder contains the Presentation explaining the general concepts of data analysis used in this project. Provide a brief overview of the topics covered in the presentation.

- **Other files:** (If you have any other relevant files, such as a requirements.txt or configuration files, mention them here.)

## Requirements

List the software and libraries required to run the Jupyter Notebooks and any additional dependencies. For example:

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- ROOT
- uproot
- awkward array
- numba
- vector
- hist
- IPython

You can also provide installation instructions if necessary.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using `git clone https://github.com/prayagyadav/ColumnarHEP.git`.
2. Navigate to the repository directory: `cd ColumnarHEP`.
3. Open Jupyter Notebook using the command `jupyter-lab`.
5. Run the notebooks from the Jupyter-lab interface.

Include any specific instructions related to the datasets, such as how to access and load them in the notebooks.

## Presentation

Provide a brief overview of the Presentation you've uploaded. Mention the key topics covered and any insights it offers.
