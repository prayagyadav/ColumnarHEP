# Columnar Analysis in High Energy Physics
Welcome to the ColumnarHEP! This repository contains Jupyter Notebooks and Presentations related to Columnar Analysis using data from two folders: 2022-08-01-uproot-awkward-columnar-hats/data and data. The notebooks showcase the use of tools like Uproot, Awkward Array, Coffea , etc. and draws insight from the provided datasets. Below, you'll find an overview of the repository contents and instructions on how to use the materials.

## Introduction

Briefly introduce the purpose of your repository and what it aims to achieve. Mention the datasets you are using and the analysis techniques you are applying.

## Repository Contents

Describe the contents of your repository, including the folder structure and the purpose of each file. For example:

- **Notebooks:** This folder contains the Jupyter Notebooks used for data analysis. Provide a brief description of each notebook, its objectives, and how it utilizes the data from the two folders.
  - `notebook1.ipynb`: Description of notebook 1.
  - `notebook2.ipynb`: Description of notebook 2.
  - `notebook3.ipynb`: Description of notebook 3.

- **Data:** This folder contains the datasets used in the notebooks. Explain the purpose of each dataset and any data preprocessing steps you've taken.

- **Presentation:** This folder contains the Presentation explaining the general concepts of data analysis used in this project. Provide a brief overview of the topics covered in the presentation.

- **Other files:** (If you have any other relevant files, such as a requirements.txt or configuration files, mention them here.)

## Requirements

List the software and libraries required to run the Jupyter Notebooks and any additional dependencies. For example:
